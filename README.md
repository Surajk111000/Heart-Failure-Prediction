#Heart Failure Prediction using SVM and ANN
This project addresses the pressing issue of heart failure mortality by harnessing the power of machine learning. It employs Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) techniques to predict outcomes with high accuracy.
The dataset used comprises 12 attributes with potential predictive value for heart failure mortality. These include age, haemoglobin and CPK enzyme levels, diabetes presence, ejection fraction, blood pressure, platelet count, serum creatinine and sodium levels, patient gender, smoking habits, and follow-up duration. The 'DEATH_EVENT' attribute signifies patient outcomes.
SVM and ANN offer distinct strengths: SVM excels at complex classification, while ANN captures intricate data patterns. By combining them, this project strives to build precise predictive models for heart failure mortality, contributing to timely interventions.
The SVM model's effectiveness is evaluated using precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. For class 0, it achieves 84% precision, 85% recall, and 0.84 F1-score, with 60 instances. For class 1, precision is 69%, recall is 67%, and F1-score is 0.68, with 30 instances. The model's overall accuracy is 79%, and the macro and weighted average F1-scores are 0.76.
In summary, this project leverages SVM and ANN to predict heart failure mortality, enhancing our ability to intervene promptly and effectively in cardiovascular health."
